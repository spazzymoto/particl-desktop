User must accept this User Statement explicitly before downloading and/or using any software related to the use and functionality of the Particl Network. This relates in particular, but not exclusively, to the Particl wallet software (&ldquo;<strong>Particl Wallet</strong>&rdquo;) and the Particl marketplace application (&ldquo;<strong>Marketplace Application</strong>&rdquo;).</p><ol type="I"><li><h3><strong>General Remarks</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>SOFTWARE CONCEPT</strong>: The Particl open source community (collectively encompassing all entities and individuals involved in the deployment, maintenance and development of the Particl Network and its applications &ldquo;<strong>Open Source Community</strong>&rdquo;) has developed a blockchain protocol, which enables confidential interactions between its users (&ldquo;<strong>User</strong>&rdquo;/&rdquo;<strong>Users</strong>&rdquo;) and the development and deployment of so called decentralized applications running on this protocol (&ldquo;<strong>Particl Protocol</strong>&rdquo;, respectively &ldquo;<strong>Particl Network</strong>&rdquo;). The Particl Network software, any of its features (e.g. cold staking, privacy applications etc.) as well as the involved front- and back-end implementations related to the Particl Network or its use (&ldquo;<strong>Particl Software</strong>&rdquo;) are developed and released under permissive open source licenses. The Particl Network in general under the MIT License and the Marketplace Application under the GNU General Public License. Both licenses form an integral part of this User Statement. WHILE THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY DEVELOPED THE PARTICL SOFTWARE, IT IS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE INTERACTIONS BY USERS AMONGST EACH OTHER OR WITH THE PARTICL SOFTWARE.</p><ol start="2" type="I"><li><h3><strong>Particl Network Live Environment</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>DEPLOYMENT OF PARTICL SOFTWARE:</strong> USER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PARTICL SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT, DESPITE BEING THOUROUGLY TESTED AND AUDITED, IS OF EXPERIMENTAL NATURE AND DEPLOYED ACCORDING TO THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY.

In particular, User acknowledges that the Particl Software, even though developed in accordance to the state of the art, is likely to contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use of data) that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or performance of the Particl Network or any application or system containing or used in conjunction with the Particl Network.</p><ol start="3" type="I"><li><h3><strong>Disclaimer of Warranty</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PARTICL SOFTWARE</strong>: To the extent permitted by applicable law, any and all warranty for the Particl Software is excluded.
